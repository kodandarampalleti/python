Additionally, lambda functions can be used to quickly and easily define operations that would otherwise require more extensive coding. This makes code more readable and easier to debug. Finally, lambda functions can be used to process data in parallel and to create custom functions for data processing."

They do not have any significance or meaning associated with them until accessed by some third-party libraries.
